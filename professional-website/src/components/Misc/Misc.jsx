                        <b>Intramural Soccer</b> - <em>University of California, Riverside</em>  (2022 - Present)
                            <p>I joined an intramural soccer team here at UCR. Since none of my friends play soccer,
                                I joined a random team. I gained a lot of insight and experience from my first team and eventually
                                moved on to a new team with some other students I met. We became friends and have gotten close to winning
                                it all. This is definitely one of my best experiences while my time here.

                        <p>The Boxing Club at UCR is something I only recently joined. I have always been fascinated 
                            with boxing and decided to start it here. I have learned a lot already and have already improved
                            so much in the short time I have been going. It is definitely something I want to continue
                            working at and getting better at.
